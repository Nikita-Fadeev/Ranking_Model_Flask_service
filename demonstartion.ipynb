    "В качестве финального проекта реализована система подсказок похожих вопросов на данных сайта Quora. Поиск производится исключительно по основному заголовку без уточняющих деталей.\n",
    "\n",
    "Система представлена микросервисом на основе Flask. Верхнеуровнево пайплайн и критерии можно представить так:\n",
    "\n",
    "Сначала происходит фильтрация запроса по языку (с помощью библиотеки LangDetect) — исключаются все запросы, для которых определённый язык не равняется \"en\". Затем происходит поиск вопросов-кандидатов с помощью FAISS (по схожести векторов) — в этой части предлагается ограничиться векторизацией только тех слов, эмбеддинги которых есть в исходных GLOVE-векторах. Эти кандидаты реранжируются KNRM-моделью, после чего до 10 кандидатов выдаются в качестве ответа.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "На сервере реализовано две ручки: для запросов (для поиска похожих вопросов) и для создания FAISS-индекса.\n",
    "\n",
    "/query — принимает POST-запрос. Должна вернуть json, где status='FAISS is not initialized!' в случае, если в решение не были загружены вопросы для поиска с помощью второго метода. \n",
    "\n",
    "Формат запроса для query:\n",
    "\n",
    "json-запрос, с единственным ключом 'queries', значение которого — список строк с вопросами (Dict[str, List[str]]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Формат ответа (в случае созданного индекса) — json с двумя полями. lang_check описывает, был ли распознан запрос как английский (List[bool], True/False-значения), suggestions — List[Optional[List[Tuple[str, str]]]].\n",
    "\n",
    "В этом списке для каждого запроса из query необходимо указать список (до 10) найденных схожих вопросов, где каждый вопрос представлен в виде Tuple, в котором первое значение — id текста (см. ниже), второе — сам непредобработанный текст схожего вопроса. Если проверка на язык не пройдена (не английский), либо произошёл какой-то сбой в обработке — оставьте None в списке вместо ответа (например, [[(..., ...), (..., ...), ...], None, ... ]).\n",
    "\n",
    "/update_index — принимает POST-запрос, в котором в json присутствует поле documents, Dict[str,str] — все документы, где ключ — id текста, значение — сам текст. На предобработку и создание индекса даётся 200 секунд. Подразумевается, что инициализация происходит единоразово, поэтому не нужно беспокоиться о повторном вызове этого метода. В возвращаемом json'е должно быть два ключа: status (ok, если всё прошло гладко) и index_size, значение которого — единственное целое число, хранящее количество документов в индексе.\n",
